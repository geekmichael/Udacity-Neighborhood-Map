As a challenged project to accomplish the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree. This project is a neighborhoop map of the Bali with my favourite attactions.

## How to run?

## Functionalities

### Map and Markers
Map displays all location markers by default, and displays the filtered subset of location markers when a filter is applied. On the filtered items of location list, corresponding map markers object by setting simply show and hide to its visibility property. The purpose of this approach is to avoid create new object at time of filter selected, and bring unsmoothness to the map.

Clicking a marker displays unique information about a location.

Icon of marker will be changed when clicked.
